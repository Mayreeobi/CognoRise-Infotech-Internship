This repository contains the tasks the I completed while working as a Data Analyst Intern at CognoRise InfoTech


## Project 1:  BIGMART SALES ANALYSIS USING SQL
The BigMart Sales Data offers a comprehensive snapshot of retail operations, encompassing detailed information about individual items, outlet specifics, and sales labels. With over 8,500 rows and multiple columns, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for gaining insights into customer preferences and uncovering meaningful patterns within the retail landscape.
* My primary goal of this analysis is to identify key metrics that shed light on various aspects of retail performance. Through the application of SQL, employing aggregation techniques, Common Table Expressions (CTE), and window functions, I aim to distill actionable insights that can inform strategic decision-making.

## Project 2: TOUR AND TRAVEL CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS Using Tableau 
Understanding customer churn dynamics is crucial for effective business strategies. The Power BI analysis provides a comprehensive view of customer churn, facilitating strategic decision-making for enhanced customer retention in the travel and tour industry.

#### Key Objectives:
* Identify and quantify the number of lost customers.
* Calculate the churn rate for business impact assessment.
* Design and implement an interactive dashboard. that provides actionable insights and recommendations to enhance customer retention strategies.

### Findings:
* Overall Churn: Out of 954 customers, the churn rate stands at 23.5%, with a total of 224 customers lost.
* Age Distribution and Churn: Ages 27 and 28 show the highest churn, with age 27 peaking at a churn rate of 56.5%. While Age 38 has the lowest number of churned customers, with only 3 churning. 
* Service-Related Churn: Service 1 has the highest number of churned customers (93), while Service 5 has the highest churn rate at 37.7%, suggesting issues specific to Service 5.
* Booking Behavior: 78.6% of churners did not book a hotel, indicating a correlation between lack of bookings and churn.
* Social Media Synchronization: 125 churned customers hadnâ€™t synced their accounts to social media, whereas 99 had synced, suggesting a potential engagement gap for non-synced accounts.
* Frequent Flyer Analysis: Frequent flyer status ('Yes') is associated with higher churn, with 147 frequent flyers churning.
* Income Impact: Low-income earners have the highest absolute churn count (104 individuals). Higher-income earners show a significant churn rate of 57.9%, likely due to unmet expectations.


### Recommendations
* Age-Specific Retention Strategies: Tailor marketing and retention strategies for ages 27 and 28, focusing on their unique needs and pain points. 
* Service Improvement Initiatives: Investigate Service 5 to improve satisfaction and reduce churn rate, and gather feedback on Service 1 to further optimize it for customer satisfaction.
* Booking Incentives:  Offer incentives to encourage hotel bookings, especially targeting customers who haven't previously booked. Improve the booking experience to address potential deterrents.
* High-Income Engagement: Create personalized engagement strategies for higher-income customers to better meet their expectations and reduce churn.
* Social Media Synchronization: Encourage social media account synchronization by emphasizing benefits like personalized offers and exclusive content for synced customers.
* Frequent Flyer Program Enhancements: Add exclusive perks, rewards, and value to the frequent flyer program to boost loyalty among this group.


## Project 3: 80 Cereals Analysis Using SQL
Cereals are a popular choice for breakfast due to their convenience and versatility. Whether enjoyed hot or cold, with or without sugar, and paired with dairy or non-dairy milk, cereals offer a quick and satisfying meal option. However, beyond convenience, it's essential to consider the nutritional value of cereals. 
This analysis aims to assess the nutritional content and sugar levels of various cereals to determine their overall healthfulness. I'll focus on factors such as high fiber content, low sugar, moderate fat levels, and low sodium content to draw conclusions about the cereals' nutritional profiles.
* SQL: Data manipulation, Aggregation functions, Window functions, CTEs and  Cross Join.
