This repository contains the tasks the I completed while working as a Data Analyst Intern at CognoRise InfoTech


## Task 1:  BIGMART SALES ANALYSIS USING SQL
The BigMart Sales Data offers a comprehensive snapshot of retail operations, encompassing detailed information about individual items, outlet specifics, and sales labels. With over 8,500 rows and multiple columns, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for gaining insights into customer preferences and uncovering meaningful patterns within the retail landscape.
* My primary goal of this analysis is to identify key metrics that shed light on various aspects of retail performance. Through the application of SQL, employing aggregation techniques, Common Table Expressions (CTE), and window functions, I aim to distill actionable insights that can inform strategic decision-making.
